# Deban-API

Deban API will be the middle-man between SEM and ML, transfering preprocessed data from SEM to ML, and utilizing output data from ML.

# Purpose
Deban API will effectively be the road that connects between SEM and ML, it will be used to preprocess the data outputted from SEM, such that it is valid input for the ML. The intention is to create an automatic process to feed data to the ML. It will also take any outputs from the ML to do further preprocessing.
